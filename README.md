# Brain-Tumor-HLS
This project was done as a course project for the course C Based VLSI Design.
The ML model we chose was sourced from https://github.com/Sarah-Hesham-2022/Doctork-Application/tree/main and the model chosen was BrainTumor_CNN.h5. 

This project is based on the implementation of Machine learning models on a hardware platfrom(like FPGA) using High Level Synthesis tools. 
The goal of the project was to optimize the design for Latency and Resource/Area constraints.
